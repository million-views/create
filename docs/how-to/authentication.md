# Authentication

Setting up git access for private template repositories.

## SSH Keys (Recommended)

Most secure method for accessing private repositories:

```bash
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"

# Add to SSH agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Copy public key to clipboard
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Add the public key to your git provider:
- **GitHub**: Settings â†’ SSH and GPG keys
- **GitLab**: User Settings â†’ SSH Keys
- **Bitbucket**: Personal settings â†’ SSH keys

## Personal Access Tokens

For HTTPS authentication:

```bash
# Configure git to store credentials
git config --global credential.helper store

# First clone will prompt for credentials
# Username: your-username
# Password: your-personal-access-token
```

### Creating Tokens

- **GitHub**: Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens
- **GitLab**: User Settings â†’ Access Tokens
- **Bitbucket**: Personal settings â†’ App passwords

Required permissions: Repository read access

## Testing Access

Verify your authentication works:

```bash
# Test SSH
ssh -T git@github.com

# Test repository access
git ls-remote https://github.com/yourorg/private-templates.git
```

## Using Private Templates

Once authenticated, use private repositories normally:

```bash
npm create @m5nv my-app -- --from-template react --repo yourorg/private-templates
```

## Troubleshooting

**Permission denied (publickey)**
- Ensure SSH key is added to SSH agent
- Verify public key is added to your git provider

**Repository not found**
- Check repository name and organization
- Verify you have access to the repository
- Ensure authentication is properly configured
