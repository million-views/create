# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the complete overhaul of project documentation to follow the Diátaxis framework, ensuring documentation serves different user needs effectively. The current documentation lacks clear structure and doesn't follow established documentation best practices. This overhaul will create a cohesive, user-focused documentation system that guides users from discovery to mastery.

## Glossary

- **Diátaxis_Framework**: A systematic approach to technical documentation with four distinct types: tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference, and explanation
- **README_Landing**: The main entry point that serves as an inviting introduction for casual visitors
- **Tutorial_Content**: Step-by-step learning-oriented documentation for beginners
- **How_To_Guides**: Task-oriented documentation for specific problems
- **Reference_Documentation**: Information-oriented comprehensive documentation
- **Explanation_Content**: Understanding-oriented documentation that provides context
- **Template_Author**: A developer creating templates for use with the CLI tool
- **End_User**: A developer using the CLI tool to scaffold projects
