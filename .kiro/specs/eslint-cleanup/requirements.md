# ESLint Cleanup Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses ESLint warnings in the @m5nv/create-scaffold codebase. ESLint has identified 21 warnings related to unused variables and parameters across multiple files. These warnings indicate potential code quality issues that should be resolved to maintain clean, maintainable code.

## Glossary

- **ESLint**: Static code analysis tool for JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Unused Variable**: A variable that is declared but never referenced
- **Unused Parameter**: A function parameter that is not used in the function body
- **Codebase**: The complete source code of @m5nv/create-scaffold

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want ESLint warnings resolved so that the code follows consistent quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `npm run lint` is executed, THEN ESLint SHALL report 0 warnings
2. WHEN unused variables are identified, THEN they SHALL be removed or prefixed with underscore if intentionally unused
3. WHEN unused parameters are identified, THEN they SHALL be removed or prefixed with underscore if required by API contracts
4. THE codebase SHALL maintain all existing functionality after cleanup

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a contributor to the project, I want clear guidelines for handling unused variables so that future code follows consistent patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHERE variables are intentionally unused for API compatibility, THEN they SHALL be prefixed with underscore (_)
2. WHERE variables are accidentally unused, THEN they SHALL be removed
3. WHERE parameters are unused due to incomplete implementation, THEN they SHALL be documented with TODO comments
4. ESLint configuration SHALL allow underscore-prefixed variables as intentionally unused
