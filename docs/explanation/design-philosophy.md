# Design Philosophy and Decisions Explained

## Introduction

@m5nv/create-scaffold embodies a specific philosophy about how project scaffolding tools should work in modern development environments. Every design decision reflects our commitment to developer autonomy, security, and simplicity while enabling powerful customization capabilities. Understanding this philosophy helps explain why the tool works the way it does and how it fits into the broader development ecosystem.

## Core Philosophy

### Developer Autonomy First

We believe developers should control their tools, not the other way around. This principle influences every aspect of the system:

- **Choice Preservation**: No lock-in to specific IDEs, hosting platforms, or workflows
- **Transparent Operations**: Users understand what the tool does and why
- **Configurable Behavior**: Key behaviors can be customized without breaking core functionality
- **Escape Hatches**: Users can always bypass automation when needed

### Security as Foundation

Security isn't an afterthought—it's built into the architecture from the ground up:

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect against different attack vectors
- **Fail Securely**: When things go wrong, they fail to a safe state
- **User Consent**: Potentially dangerous operations require explicit user approval
- **Information Protection**: Error messages and logs don't leak sensitive information

### Simplicity Over Features

We prioritize doing core functionality exceptionally well over adding every possible feature:

- **Single Responsibility**: The tool does project scaffolding, not project management
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Fewer dependencies mean fewer security risks and faster startup
- **Clear Mental Model**: Users can predict how the tool will behave
- **Composable Design**: Works well with other tools rather than replacing them

## The Options System Philosophy

### Flexibility Without Complexity

The options system represents our approach to template customization:

```bash
# Simple, discoverable syntax
create-scaffold my-project --from-template user/repo --options typescript,testing,docker
```

**Design Principles:**
- **Comma-Separated Simplicity**: Easy to type, parse, and understand
- **Template-Controlled**: Templates define what options mean and how they're used
- **Validation at Boundaries**: Options are validated for safety but not content
- **Extensible**: New options can be added without changing the CLI tool

### Template Flexibility Approach

Templates have complete control over how options are interpreted:

```javascript
// In template _setup.mjs
const { options } = Environment_Object;

if (options.includes('typescript')) {
  await setupTypeScript();
}

if (options.includes('testing')) {
  await setupTestFramework();
}

// Templates can combine options intelligently
if (options.includes('typescript') && options.includes('testing')) {
  await setupTypeScriptTesting();
}
```

**Benefits:**
- **Template Innovation**: Template authors can create sophisticated option systems
- **Template Stability**: New options enhance existing templates without disruption
- **User Discovery**: Users learn options from template documentation
- **Ecosystem Growth**: Rich option ecosystems can emerge around popular templates

## Major Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Git-Native Template Distribution

**The Decision:** Use git repositories as the primary template distribution mechanism.

**Reasoning:**
- **Familiar Workflow**: Developers already know git
- **Built-in Versioning**: Branches and tags provide version management
- **Decentralized**: No central registry to maintain or control
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Leverages GitHub, GitLab, and other existing platforms

**Trade-offs:**
- **Gained**: Familiar workflow, zero infrastructure, built-in versioning, easy sharing
- **Given up**: Some performance optimizations, custom metadata capabilities

**Impact on Ecosystem:**
- **Low Barrier to Entry**: Anyone can create templates using existing git knowledge
- **Viral Distribution**: Templates spread through existing developer networks
- **Platform Independence**: Works with any git hosting solution

### Decision 2: JavaScript Setup Scripts

**The Decision:** Use JavaScript (Node.js) for template setup scripts.

**Reasoning:**
- **Runtime Availability**: Node.js is already required for the CLI tool
- **Developer Familiarity**: Most web developers know JavaScript
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Access to npm packages for complex setup tasks
- **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently across operating systems

**Trade-offs:**
- **Gained**: Powerful scripting capabilities, familiar language, rich ecosystem
- **Given up**: Support for other scripting languages, some performance

**Impact on Templates:**
- **Sophisticated Setup**: Templates can perform complex post-scaffolding operations
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Can integrate with existing JavaScript tooling
- **Learning Curve**: Template authors need JavaScript knowledge for advanced features

### Decision 3: User Directory Caching

**The Decision:** Cache repositories in user home directory (`~/.m5nv/cache/`).

**Reasoning:**
- **Permission Simplicity**: No special permissions required
- **User Isolation**: Each user has independent cache
- **Persistence**: Survives project deletion and system updates
- **Predictable Location**: Easy to find and manage

**Trade-offs:**
- **Gained**: Simple permissions, user isolation, persistence
- **Given up**: System-wide cache sharing, some storage efficiency

**Impact on Performance:**
- **Individual Optimization**: Each user's cache optimizes for their usage patterns
- **Storage Predictability**: Users control their own cache storage
- **Maintenance Simplicity**: No system administrator involvement required

### Decision 4: Explicit IDE Specification

**The Decision:** Require users to explicitly specify IDE rather than auto-detecting.

**Reasoning:**
- **Clear Intent**: Users explicitly state their development environment
- **Reliability**: No detection failures or edge cases
- **Privacy**: No need to inspect running processes or file systems
- **Simplicity**: Straightforward implementation and testing

**Trade-offs:**
- **Gained**: Reliability, privacy, simplicity, clear user intent
- **Given up**: Convenience of automatic detection

**Impact on User Experience:**
- **Intentional Choices**: Users make deliberate decisions about their environment
- **Predictable Behavior**: Same command always produces same result
- **Documentation Clarity**: Clear examples in documentation and help text

### Decision 5: Security-First Input Validation

**The Decision:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs before processing.

**Reasoning:**
- **Attack Prevention**: Stops entire classes of attacks at the input layer
- **Fail Fast**: Catch problems before expensive operations
- **Clear Errors**: Validation errors are easier to understand than runtime failures
- **Audit Trail**: All inputs are logged and can be audited

**Trade-offs:**
- **Gained**: Security, reliability, clear error messages
- **Given up**: Some flexibility in naming and path conventions

**Impact on Security:**
- **Defense in Depth**: First layer of comprehensive security model
- **User Protection**: Users are protected even from their own mistakes
- **Template Safety**: Template authors can assume inputs are safe

## Trade-offs and Limitations

### Conscious Limitations

We deliberately chose not to support certain features:

**No Built-in Project Management:**
- **Why**: Keeps tool focused and composable with existing project management tools
- **Impact**: Users combine with other tools for full project lifecycle

**No Custom Scripting Languages:**
- **Why**: Reduces complexity and leverages existing Node.js runtime
- **Impact**: Template authors must use JavaScript for setup scripts

**No Central Template Registry:**
- **Why**: Avoids infrastructure burden and control concerns
- **Impact**: Template discovery happens through existing developer networks

**No Real-time Template Updates:**
- **Why**: Caching and security require deliberate update cycles
- **Impact**: Users must explicitly refresh templates or wait for TTL expiration

### Accepted Trade-offs

**Performance vs. Security:**
- **Choice**: Comprehensive input validation over raw performance
- **Rationale**: Security vulnerabilities are more costly than performance overhead
- **Mitigation**: Caching and optimization where security allows

**Simplicity vs. Features:**
- **Choice**: Simple, predictable behavior over feature richness
- **Rationale**: Complex tools are harder to understand, debug, and secure
- **Mitigation**: Extensibility through template system rather than core features

**User Control vs. Automation:**
- **Choice**: Explicit user choices over automatic behavior
- **Rationale**: Developers prefer predictable tools they can understand and control
- **Mitigation**: Good defaults and clear documentation reduce friction

## Broader Ecosystem Context

### Position in Development Toolchain
