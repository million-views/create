## Delivered Features (Phase 1)

### Placeholder Prompts (Experimental)

- **Problem:** Templates needed a consistent way to resolve `{{TOKEN}}`
  placeholders without rebuilding ad-hoc prompts in every setup script.
- **Solution:** Added an opt-in placeholder resolver
  (`--experimental-placeholder-prompts`) that merges metadata defaults, repeated
  `--placeholder NAME=value` flags, environment variables
  (`CREATE_SCAFFOLD_PLACEHOLDER_<TOKEN>`), and interactive prompts. Setup
  scripts receive resolved values via `ctx.inputs`, `tools.inputs`, and
  `tools.placeholders.applyInputs()`.
- **Impact:** Medium ‚Äì unlocks richer customization while the feature hardens
  behind an experimental flag.

### Template Schema Standardization

- **Problem:** Template authors and downstream tooling relied on ad-hoc manifest
  conventions, making validation brittle and integrations error-prone.
- **Solution:** Published a versioned JSON Schema (`schema/template.v1.json`)
  with a synced latest alias, generated type declarations/runtime stubs
  (`npm run schema:build` / `npm run schema:check`), and exported them via
  package entrypoints for reuse.
- **Impact:** High ‚Äì establishes a single source of truth for manifest
  structure, enables automated validation, and unblocks ecosystem tooling.

### Template Variables (Canonical Defaults)

- **Problem:** Templates needed reusable values such as `{{AUTHOR}}` and
  `{{LICENSE}}` without duplicating metadata between manifests and setup
  scripts.
- **Solution:** Introduced a canonical variables registry, extended the schema
  and generated types to declare overrides, and merged defaults during template
  validation so runtime tools expose a normalized placeholder view.
- **Impact:** High ‚Äì improves metadata quality, keeps downstream integrations
  consistent, and simplifies author workflows.

### Template Caching

- **Problem:** Repeated clones are slow; other features need fast repository
  access.
- **Solution:** Cache repositories in `~/.m5nv/cache` with TTL, plus a
  `--no-cache` flag to bypass when necessary.
- **Impact:** High ‚Äì foundation for all other features and a significant
  performance improvement.

### Detailed Logging

- **Problem:** Users could not debug failures or audit what the tool executed.
- **Solution:** `--log-file path/to/log` writes timestamped operations (git
  clone, file copy, setup execution, errors) to user-approved locations.
- **Impact:** High ‚Äì essential for production use and troubleshooting.

### Template Discovery

- **Problem:** Users did not know what templates were available.
- **Solution:** `--list-templates` leverages the cached repository to instantly
  show templates with descriptions sourced from `template.json` or README
  frontmatter.
- **Impact:** High ‚Äì removes the biggest user friction point and remains fast
  because of caching.

### Dry Run Mode

- **Problem:** Users wanted to preview operations before executing them.
- **Solution:** `--dry-run` displays planned operations without executing them
  while still using the cache for fast previews.
- **Impact:** Medium ‚Äì builds confidence, especially for CI/CD.

## Phase 2 ¬∑ Developer Experience (Delivered v0.4)

**Objective:** Reduce template author friction and provide guardrails that keep
manifests healthy.

- **Template Validation:** `--validate-template` command reuses the published
  schema/types for manifest checks, layers setup-script linting and
  required-file verification, and supports JSON output for CI.
  **Impact:** Medium ‚Äì prevents frustration, improves template quality.
- **Configuration File:** `.m5nvrc` discovery with environment overrides enables
  defaults for repository, branch, author metadata, and placeholder values.
  **Impact:** Medium ‚Äì enables team standards and reduces setup time.
- **Interactive Mode:** Invoking without arguments or supplying `--interactive`
  launches guided discovery to collect inputs before scaffolding.
  **Impact:** Medium ‚Äì lowers the barrier for new users and onboarding sessions.

**Dependencies:** Canonical schema/types (delivered); caching (delivered).

**Key Metrics:** Validation command adoption in template CI pipelines;
reduction in template onboarding support tickets.

## Phase 3 ¬∑ Advanced Workflows (Target v0.5)

**Objective:** Enable complex project compositions and advanced automation use
cases.

- **Multi-Template Projects:** Add `--from-templates frontend,backend` to stage
  multiple templates in one run with orchestrated setup sequencing. **Impact:**
  Low ‚Äì niche but high-value for larger teams; high complexity.
- **Workflow Automation Enhancements:** Expand canonical variables with richer
  manifest hooks (e.g., templated README sections) and explore scripted
  post-processing once validation lands. **Impact:** Medium ‚Äì powers internal
  enablement tooling.

**Dependencies:** Phase 2 validation workflows; canonical variables (delivered).

**Key Metrics:** Multi-template usage in customer engagements; positive feedback
from design partners.

## Phase 4 ¬∑ Ecosystem Health (Target v0.6)

**Objective:** Guarantee high-quality community templates and transparent health
reporting.

- **Template Health Checks:** Automate template testing (dependency install,
  smoke commands) built on top of schema exports to standardize reporting and
  enforcement. **Impact:** Low ‚Äì community feature requiring infrastructure but
  critical for trust.
- **Community Governance Toolkit:** Document contribution SLAs, lint rules, and
  template quality scorecards surfaced via CLI metadata. **Impact:** Medium ‚Äì
  supports ecosystem stewardship.

**Dependencies:** Stable validation tooling; hosted telemetry pipeline.

**Key Metrics:** Percentage of public templates passing health checks; community
contribution velocity.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1 (Complete) Rationale

- **Caching** is foundational infrastructure that accelerates all other
  features.
- **Logging** solves immediate production needs.
- **Discovery** removes biggest user barrier and is fast thanks to caching.
- **Dry run** builds user confidence and benefits from cached repository access.
- All are high-value, with caching being the strategic enabler.

### Success Metrics

- **Phase 1:** Reduced support requests, increased template repository usage.
- **Phase 2:** Higher user retention, more template repositories created.
- **Phase 3:** Power user adoption, enterprise usage.
- **Phase 4:** Community ecosystem growth.

### Technical Considerations

- Maintain zero external dependencies.
- All features must pass comprehensive security review.
- Clean, modern implementation required.
- Each feature needs comprehensive test coverage.

## Non-Goals

- **GUI Interface** - CLI-first tool.
- **Template Hosting** - Use existing git infrastructure.
- **Package Management** - Not competing with npm/yarn.
- **Build System Integration** - Templates handle their own build setup.
