# Security Model Explained

## Introduction

@m5nv/create-scaffold implements a comprehensive security-first approach to template processing and project scaffolding. This security model protects users from common attack vectors while maintaining the flexibility needed for effective template systems. Understanding this model helps you use the tool safely and create secure templates.

## The Problem

Template scaffolding tools face unique security challenges:

- **Arbitrary Code Execution**: Templates could contain malicious setup scripts
- **Path Traversal Attacks**: Malicious templates could write files outside project boundaries
- **Input Injection**: User inputs could be crafted to execute unintended commands
- **Information Disclosure**: Error messages could leak sensitive system information
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Dependencies or remote templates could be compromised

## Our Approach

We implement defense-in-depth with multiple security layers that work together to create a secure scaffolding environment.

### Key Principles

1. **Input Validation First**: Every user input is validated and sanitized before processing
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Operations are restricted to the minimum necessary scope
3. **Fail Securely**: When errors occur, the system fails to a safe state without leaking information
4. **User Consent for Execution**: Setup scripts require explicit user understanding and consent
5. **Transparent Security**: Security measures are visible and understandable to users

## How It Works

### Input Sanitization and Validation

Every user input goes through comprehensive validation:

```javascript
// Project names are restricted to safe characters
validateProjectDirectory(projectName) // Only alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores

// Repository URLs are validated against injection attempts
validateRepoUrl(repoUrl) // Prevents malicious redirects and private network access

// Template names prevent directory traversal
validateTemplateName(templateName) // Blocks ../../../etc/passwd attempts

// Branch names follow git naming rules and prevent injection
sanitizeBranchName(branchName) // Blocks command injection via branch names
```

### Path Traversal Prevention

All file operations are bounded to prevent escaping project directories:

- **Relative Path Enforcement**: Absolute paths are rejected
- **Directory Traversal Blocking**: `../` sequences are detected and blocked
- **Boundary Validation**: All resolved paths must stay within allowed directories
- **Null Byte Protection**: Null bytes in paths are detected and rejected

### Command Injection Prevention

Git operations and system commands are protected against injection:

- **Parameter Validation**: All git parameters are validated before use
- **No Shell Expansion**: Commands are executed without shell interpretation
- **Sanitized Error Messages**: Error outputs are cleaned of sensitive information
- **Timeout Protection**: Operations have reasonable timeouts to prevent hanging

### Information Disclosure Protection

Error messages are sanitized to prevent information leakage:

```javascript
// Before: "Error: /Users/john/secret-project/.git not found"
// After: "Error: [path] not found"

// Removes: file paths, usernames, IP addresses, tokens, environment variables
```

## Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Comprehensive Input Validation

**Why we chose this:** Every attack vector starts with malicious input. By validating all inputs at the entry point, we prevent entire classes of attacks.

**Trade-offs:**
- **Gained**: Protection against injection, traversal, and malformed input attacks
- **Given up**: Some flexibility in naming conventions and path structures

**Alternatives considered:**
- Partial validation (rejected - leaves attack vectors open)
- Runtime validation only (rejected - allows malicious data to propagate)

### Decision 2: Setup Script Isolation

**Why we chose this:** Setup scripts run in the user's project context, not the CLI tool's context, preventing privilege escalation.

**Trade-offs:**
- **Gained**: Protection against CLI tool compromise via malicious templates
- **Given up**: Some convenience features that would require elevated privileges

**Alternatives considered:**
- Sandboxed execution (rejected - too complex for the use case)
- No setup scripts (rejected - reduces template flexibility)

### Decision 3: Error Message Sanitization

**Why we chose this:** Error messages often contain sensitive information that could aid attackers or leak private data.

**Trade-offs:**
- **Gained**: Protection against information disclosure
- **Given up**: Some debugging convenience (though logs can contain full details)

**Alternatives considered:**
- Verbose errors in development mode (rejected - mode detection is unreliable)
- User-configurable verbosity (rejected - increases complexity)

### Decision 4: Cache Security

**Why we chose this:** Cached repositories are stored in user directories with proper permissions and integrity checking.

**Trade-offs:**
- **Gained**: Protection against cache poisoning and unauthorized access
- **Given up**: Some performance optimizations that would compromise security

**Alternatives considered:**
- System-wide cache (rejected - permission and isolation issues)
- No integrity checking (rejected - allows cache corruption attacks)

## Implications

### For Users

- **Safe by Default**: You can use templates from unknown sources with reduced risk
- **Clear Warnings**: Setup script execution is clearly communicated and requires consent
- **Predictable Behavior**: Security restrictions are consistent and documented
- **Error Clarity**: While sanitized, error messages still provide actionable information

### For Template Authors

- **Naming Constraints**: Template and file names must follow security-safe patterns
- **Setup Script Limitations**: Scripts run in project context with user permissions only
- **Path Restrictions**: Templates cannot write files outside the project directory
- **Validation Requirements**: All template metadata must pass validation checks

### For the Ecosystem

- **Trust Model**: Users can safely try templates without full trust relationships
- **Standardization**: Security patterns can be adopted by similar tools
- **Transparency**: Open security model allows community review and improvement
- **Compatibility**: Security measures don't break standard git or npm workflows

## Limitations

Our security model has intentional limitations that users should understand:

1. **Setup Script Trust**: Once you consent to setup script execution, it runs with your user permissions
2. **Repository Trust**: We validate repository URLs but cannot verify repository content integrity
3. **Network Security**: We rely on git and npm's network security for remote operations
4. **Local System Security**: We cannot protect against compromised local systems or credentials
5. **Template Content**: We validate structure but cannot analyze template file contents for malicious code

## Future Considerations

### Planned Enhancements

- **Content Scanning**: Static analysis of template files for suspicious patterns
- **Signature Verification**: Support for signed templates with cryptographic verification
- **Sandbox Improvements**: Enhanced isolation for setup script execution
- **Audit Logging**: Detailed security event logging for enterprise environments

### Research Areas

- **Machine Learning Detection**: Automated detection of malicious template patterns
- **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proofs of security properties
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Assume all inputs and templates are potentially malicious
- **Integration Security**: Secure integration with IDE and development environment features
