# Template Undo Ignore — Tasks

1. ✅ Completed — Implemented shared ignore utility so `.template-undo.json` is skipped during core template copy and dry-run operations.
2. ✅ Completed — Updated setup runtime helpers (notably `tools.files.copyFromTemplate`) to respect the ignore list.
3. ✅ Completed — Refreshed dry run and CLI integration tests to cover the new ignore behaviour and added targeted runtime helper coverage.
4. ✅ Completed — Updated author and maintainer documentation to mention the ignored undo artifact.
