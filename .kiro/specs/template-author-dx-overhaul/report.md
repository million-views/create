# Execution Report

## Completed According to Plan
- Sandboxed runtime implemented and wired into the CLI.
- Standard helper toolkit (placeholders, files, json, templates, logger, IDE presets) delivered.
- Optional ast-grep adapter implemented with graceful degradation messaging.
- Template metadata now supports `setup.supportedOptions` with CLI warnings for unsupported flags.
- Fixture templates, integration tests, and documentation refreshed to use the new `(ctx, tools)` contract.
- Full test suite (`npm test`) executed successfully.

## Deviations

### 1. Ast-grep Adapter Tests
- **Planned task:** Provide tests stubbing the adapter for deterministic behavior.
- **Status:** Not implemented.
- **Reason:** The CLI environment does not ship with `@ast-grep/napi`, and stubbing the native binding within the sandboxed module loader requires additional harness work that exceeded the current iteration scope. Runtime behavior is still covered indirectly via feature detection, but explicit adapter tests remain to-do.

### 2. IDE Preset Examples in `docs/_templates`
- **Planned task:** Create or refresh IDE preset examples in `docs/_templates`.
- **Status:** Not implemented.
- **Reason:** Existing documentation references inline examples after the helper API rewrite. No separate reusable preset examples were added pending a decision on the long-term format of documentation snippets. This can be revisited once the team settles on whether shared JSON snippets should live in that directory.

### 3. Dry-run Output Capture for Docs
- **Planned task:** Capture dry-run output demonstrating new setup messaging in docs/examples.
- **Status:** Not completed.
- **Reason:** Documentation updates focused on narrative and API references. Capturing fresh CLI transcripts was deferred to avoid embedding point-in-time output that may change as formatting evolves. A follow-up doc polishing pass can record stable examples if required.

## Follow-up Suggestions
- Add a lightweight test harness that injects a mocked `@ast-grep/napi` module into the sandbox to exercise `tools.astGrep` code paths.
- Decide on the future of `docs/_templates` (keep or retire). If kept, populate it with JSON preset samples referenced by the new toolkit documentation.
- When documentation stabilizes, record a representative `--dry-run` invocation and link or embed it in the tutorial for completeness.
